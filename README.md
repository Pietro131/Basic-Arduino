# Basic-Arduino




# Hello Arduino

# Description: 

The point of this was to get us used to Arduino. In this assignment, we arranged the wires and the arduino so it would blink every 500 milliseconds.

This one took me a while but with the help of Mr. Dierolf I got it. I was having some troubles with the web editor not working with my computer, but those have been resolved.

# Reflection

So I did this once, with the help of Mr. Dierolf, and the code worked, but I didn't record it working or screenshot the code. Then, I lost the code. So I had to try and do the code again, I tried bymyself and got the core concepts down, but I made a few mistakes. So Mr. Dierolf helped me fix those mistakes. I think that it was actually a blessing in disguise that I lost the code, because even though I am behind track a little now I learned more from that assignment than I did the first time. I am excited for the next one!
