# Basic-Arduino




# Hello Arduino

# Description: 

The point of this was to get us used to Arduino. In this assignment, we arranged the wires and the arduino so it would blink every 500 milliseconds.

This one took me a while but with the help of Mr. Dierolf I got it. I was having some troubles with the web editor not working with my computer, but those have been resolved.

# Finite LED Blinker

# Description 

The point of this assignment was to make an LED blink a certain amount of times, and then stop blinking. So, I made it blink 5 times, and then stop blinking.

# Reflection

So I did this once, with the help of Mr. Dierolf, and the code worked, but I didn't record it working or screenshot the code. Then, I lost the code. So I had to try and do the code again, I tried bymyself and got the core concepts down, but I made a few mistakes. So Mr. Dierolf helped me fix those mistakes. I think that it was actually a blessing in disguise that I lost the code, because even though I am behind track a little now I learned more from that assignment than I did the first time. I am excited for the next one!

# Variable LED Blinker

# Description

The point of this assignment was to learn how to use the "delayVar"
What we had to do is make it so that the Arduino would blink on for 2 seconds then off for 2 seconds, then it would blink on for 1.8 seconds and off for 1.8 seconds, then on for 1.6 seconds and off for 1.6 seconds, and so on. Eventually the blinker would get to on for .2 seconds and off for .2 seconds, once it got there the blinker was supposed to stop going down and just keep blinking on and off at .2 seconds.

This one was pretty hard, I'm not gonna lie, I'm not very good at Arduino. I needed help from Mr. Dierolf for this one as well, but unlike the other ones I had the rough idea down before I went to him, he helped me smooth it over and fix any mistakes I made here and there. I'm excited for the next one, and I think I'll be able to do it on my own!

# Button Activated LED

# Description

For this project I had to wire the arduino and set the code so that when I pushed a button the light goes on and when I release it the light turns off.

This was not as hard as the other ones.
